This is a Preset Vault.
This note has all the settings and instructions to get started in Obsidian.
This ReadMe is targeted to users who use primarily a language like Urdu, Farsi, Arabic.

Obsidian currently don't support Urdu completely.
But this vault has been adapted to allow Urdu typing, and Urdu phonetic keyboard layout.
